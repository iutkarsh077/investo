## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to:

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the layout adapts well across different screen sizes.
- Use the Framer Motion library to create smooth animations for the user interface.
- Manage component states effectively in React using hooks like `useState`.

Hereâ€™s a code snippet demonstrating the dynamic pricing calculation based on user-selected page views:

```javascript
const calculatePrice = (views) => {
  if (views < 100) return 8;
  if (views >= 100 && views < 500) return 12;
  if (views >= 500 && views < 1000) return 24;
  if (views === 1000) return 36;
  return 16; // Fallback price
};
